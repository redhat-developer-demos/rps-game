# roshambo-backend

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## S3 Upload Functionality

NOTE: Only enable this feature for internal development!

This Quarkus backend can process user supplied images of their hand to
determine if they're choosing rock, paper, or scissors as their move.

These images can be uploaded to an S3 bucket for use in fine-tuning the model
used to classify images. 

To use enable feature:

1. Create a S3 Bucket. Default name: `rps-game-images`.
1. Configure an user in IAM with write access to the bucket.
1. Download an Access Key ID and Secret for that user.
1. Set the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` in the environment.

With those variables set, the Quarkus application will upload images to the
configured S3 bucket.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/roshambo-backend-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.
